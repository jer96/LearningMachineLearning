# LearningMachineLearning

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey for learning Data Science and Machine Learning using various online resources. 

## Overview
Currently, I am participating in the #100DaysOfMLCode challenge hosted by [Siraj Raval](youtube.com/c/SirajRaval) wherein everyday I spend a certain amount of time dedicated to working on machine learning in the form of online courses, projects or research. 

## Progress
**Days 1-5**

Completed Lectures 1-7 of [MIT OCW Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability](
https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2) with corresponding problem sets.

**Day 6**

Began Siraj Raval's [Learn Python for Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU) Tutorial. [Completed Gender Classification](https://youtu.be/T5pRlIbr6gg) Challenge which can be found [here](https://github.com/jer96/LearningMachineLearning/tree/master/gender_classification_challenge).

**Day 7**
