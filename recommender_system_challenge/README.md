Recommender System Challenge by Siraj Raval on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/9gBC9R-msAk). Here I have completed the recommender system challenge wherein I found a new data source to gather data to recommend books users. The data is the Book Crossing dataset, which provides a set of anonymized users and their ratings of various books. I created bookcrossing.py, which is a file dedicated to parsing and formatting the raw data of the dataset and creating interaction matrices to supply each model under study. Further, I implemented three additional models from the Lightfm module and reported results.
