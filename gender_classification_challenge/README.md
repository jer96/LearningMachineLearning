## gender_classification_challenge

 Here I have completed the gender_classification challenge. Using the adapted code, I implemented three additional classifiers (SVM, Gradient Boost Classifier and Multi-layer perceptron) from the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) machine learning library. I split the data into a train/test set which I then used to compute the accuracy of each classifier.
